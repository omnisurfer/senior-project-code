; PICkit 2 Lesson 11 - Moving Average Filter
;
; This shows using the FSR to implement a Moving Average filter
; it reads the pot value via the A2D converter, Averages the result
; with the last 7 readings and displays the High order bits on the 
; 4 bit LED display. The pot on the Low Pin Count Demo board varies 
; the voltage coming in on RA0.

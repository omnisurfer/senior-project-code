; PICkit 2 Lesson 4 - "A2D"
;
; This shows how to read the A2D converter and display the
; High order parts on the 4 bit LED display.
; The pot on the Low Pin Count Demo board varies the voltage 
; coming in on in A0.
;
; The A2D is referenced to the same Vdd as the device, which 
; is provided by the USB cable and nominally is 5V.  The A2D
; returns the ratio of the voltage on Pin RA0 to 5V.  The A2D
; has a resolution of 10 bits, with 1023 representing 5V and
; 0 representing 0V.
